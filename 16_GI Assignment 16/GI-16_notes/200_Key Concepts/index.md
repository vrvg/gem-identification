146. The most popular transparent orange, yellow, and brown gems are diamond, corundum, citrine, garnet, and topaz.

149. Diamond's characteristics include SR nature, OTL RI, moderate fire, adamantine luster, and mineral inclusions.

153. Many HPHT-processed diamonds lack visible signs of treatment and require advanced testing by a gemological laboratory.

153. Flux inclusions and hourglass graining help identify synthetic diamonds because natural diamonds don't have these characteristics.

Natural corundum typically contains a greater variety of inclusions than synthetic corundum.

Heat treatment can alter corundum's characteristic inclusions, fluorescence, and spectrum.

Immersion is the most effective way to detect lattice diffusion treatment in corundum.

Flame-fusion synthetic sapphires are the most abundant synthetic corundum gems on the market.

Diffused lighting can help you identify curved color banding in flame-fusion synthetic yellow and orange sapphire.

Natural orange and yellow sapphires can often be separated from melt-process synthetics by their differing spectra.

Under magnification, hydrothermal synthetic sapphires often show chevrons and other characteristic growth features.

Garnet is on of only a few SR gem materials.

Spessartine's SR nature, high RI, and distinctive absorption spectrum easily identify it.

Malaya garnets are spessartine-pyrope garnets that range from light to dark slightly pinkish to reddish to yellowish orange.

Grossular garnets have perhaps the widest color range of all the garnets.

Beryl's RI of approximately 1.57 to 1.58 readily distinguishes it from corundum, quartz, topaz, spodumene, and tourmaline.

A very constant RI of 1.54 to 1.55 and 0.009 birefringence are key identifying features for citrine and smoky quartz.

Fire opal's low RI and SR nature are key identifying features.

Visible doubling and a distinctive spectrum can help you separate most orange, yellow, and brown zircon from other OTL gems.

Many orange, yellow, and brown transparent gems also have translucent-to-opaque versions.

Cat's-eye chrysoberyl's RI of 1.75 to 1.76 separates it from other chatoyant gems.

Goldstone glass contains gas bubbles and copper inclusions that separate it from the sunstone it imitates.
